# [screensavers.cool](https://screensavers.cool)

List of screensavers I like.

## Running Locally

Get the source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/soffes/screensavers.cool
    $ cd screensavers.cool

Get the dependencies:

    $ npm install

Now you can start the server:

    $ npm run dev

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see it running.

If you have issues getting it up and running, [send me an email](mailto:sam@soff.es).
